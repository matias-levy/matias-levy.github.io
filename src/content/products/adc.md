title: "ADC"
description: "ADC is a versatile Eurorack module by MLA Labs combining analog and digital functions. It operates as a digital sample and hold with an extra 8 outputs that represent the 8 most significant bits of the sampled signal. It can act as a gate randomizer, gate proto-sequencer, and noise generator (analog and digital), among many other things.
There are two modes of operation: Triggered (sampling input signals with trigger control) and Free-Running (sampling each bit of the input on a different sample rate).
Features include bit rotation via CV, rate of the Free-Running mode via CV, internal noise source, and configurable jumpers for advanced behavior. Ideal for creating chaotic CV, digital noise, or randomized triggers on a small footprint."
